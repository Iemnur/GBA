GBA Japanese To English Translation
====================================
<br />
Translation by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass assembler:<br />

I have also included an IPS file of the translation as a patch.<br />
<br />
Please check out RomHacking & their forum, a great resource for translation work:<br />

<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
You will need the original Japanese ROM in .gba (Little-Endian) Format, in the root directory of this patch<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.gba) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />
Or you can patch the original Japanese ROM using the IPS file.<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real GBA using a flash cartridge.<br />
<br />
You can also use GBA emulators like mGBA, no$gba, higan & the MAME GBA Driver.
