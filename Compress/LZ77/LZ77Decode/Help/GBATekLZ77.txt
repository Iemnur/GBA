Expands LZ77-compressed data. The Wram function is faster, and writes in units of 8bits. For the Vram function the destination must be halfword aligned, data is written in units of 16bits.
 If the size of the compressed data is not a multiple of 4, please adjust it as much as possible by padding with 0. Align the source address to a 4-Byte boundary.  r0   Source address, pointing to data as such:
        Data header (32bit)
          Bit 0-3   Reserved
          Bit 4-7   Compressed type (must be 1 for LZ77)
          Bit 8-31  Size of decompressed data
        Repeat below. Each Flag Byte followed by eight Blocks.
        Flag data (8bit)
          Bit 0-7   Type Flags for next 8 Blocks, MSB first
        Block Type 0 - Uncompressed - Copy 1 Byte from Source to Dest
          Bit 0-7   One data byte to be copied to dest
        Block Type 1 - Compressed - Copy N+3 Bytes from Dest-Disp-1 to Dest
          Bit 0-3   Disp MSBs
          Bit 4-7   Number of bytes to copy (minus 3)
          Bit 8-15  Disp LSBs
  r1   Destination address
  r2  Callback parameter (NDS SWI 12h only, see Callback notes below)
  r3  Callback structure (NDS SWI 12h only, see Callback notes below)

Return: No return value.
