# DCT Value At The Upper Left Corner Is Called The "DC" Value.
# This Is The Abbreviation For "Direct Current" & Refers To A Similar Phenomenon
# In The Theory Of Alternating Current Where An Alternating Current Can Have A Direct Component.
# In DCT The "DC" Value Determines The Average Brightness In The Block.
# All Other Values Describe The Variation Around This DC value.
# Therefore They Are Sometimes Referred To As "AC" Values (From "Alternating Current").
